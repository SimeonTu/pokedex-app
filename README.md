# Pok√©dex App
A web application that acts as an encyclopedia for Pokemon, and allows you to quickly look up information about any Pokemon.

## Features and Usage
- Find Pokemon by various methods - search for a specific Pokemon using the search bar, filter by generations 1-9, or just scroll down through a list of all currently released Pokemon.
- Click on a Pokemon to display a modal with more information about it, including their type/s, height, weight, ID, and base stats.
- Stylish and responsive UI - works on any screen size and backgrounds and other elements adapt to each Pokemon's color.
- Automatically loads more Pokemon as you scroll down the page (after you press the "Load more Pokemon" button).

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript with jQuery
- Bootstrap 5.3
- [ColorThief](https://github.com/lokesh/color-thief) by Lokesh Dhakar
- [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) used for fetching all the information about each Pokemon

## Future Work
If I were to spend more development time to further expand on the project, I'd add more filtering options such as Pokemon type, weakness, ID, weight, height etc. and also display more information about each Pokemon such as abilities, alt-variants, description etc. to make it a more comprehensive encyclopedia. An idea I also had is to add a quiz game option that asks you trivia questions about the Pokemon to test your knowledge. I would also like to make the design more consistent by establishing a proper color scheme and keeping the UI elements stylistically consistent with each other. An error-handling feature to tell the user that they might be offline and that data couldn't be loaded would be useful.
